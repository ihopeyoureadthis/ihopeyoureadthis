Hii lovieee

I don't even know if you'll ever read this.
But if you do.. I just want you to know, I still think about you sometimes.
We both tried. We both cared. But the universe just never gave us enough space to become "us".
I just wonder... If we had met at a different point in life, would the ending have been different?
Anyway, I hope you're doing okay, even though we're not in each other's
lives anymore
